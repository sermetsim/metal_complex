    "The study of complexes is an important facet of chemistry. Indeed, chemical complexes have many fields of application such as catalysis, biorganic chemistry and organometallic chemistry. Complexes are usually formed from a central metal bound to several ligands. Although it may seem simple, complexes are sometimes difficult to guide. Indeed, ligands can be significant molecules, which makes the visualization of the complex and the study of its properties difficult. A principal property in the study of complexes is the oxidation state of central metal. Indeed, the oxidation state of the metal can influence the 3D structure but also the properties of the complex (the oxidation state of a metal can for example determine whether it has a high or low spin and thus what will be the possible UV-visible transitions of the complex).\n",
    "\n",
    "This report details the development and execution of a program whose purpose is to simplify the study of complexes by allowing the 3D visualization of the complexes, obtaining the oxidation state of the central metal and calculating the molar mass of the complex. \n"
