    "The study of complexes is an important facet of chemistry. Indeed, chemical complexes have many fields of application such as catalysis, biorganic chemistry and organometallic chemistry. Complexes are usually formed from a central metal bound to several ligands. Although it may seem simple, complexes are sometimes difficult to guide. Indeed, ligands can be significant molecules, which makes the visualization of the complex and the study of its properties difficult. A principal property in the study of complexes is the oxidation state of central metal. Indeed, the oxidation state of the metal can influence the 3D structure but also the properties of the complex (the oxidation state of a metal can for example determine whether it has a high or low spin and thus what will be the possible UV-visible transitions of the complex).\n",

    "### 1. Modelise 3D metal complex\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and most difficult step was to model the complex in 3D. The problem encountered was that the 3Dmol Python library could not draw the given complex correctly as it was too complex and large. To resolve this, a function determining the coordinates of each atom of each ligand was written. However, a problem occurred when trying to connect these atoms, as the program would sometimes connect the wrong atoms together or not respect the octet rule (e.g., a hydrogen atom with two bonds). \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, another solution was found. Instead of connecting them directly in 3D, the ligands and the metal were grouped in the same 2D plane. With the help of a database, the coordinates of the linkage atoms of the ligands could be determined and bound to the metal. Once the final complex was formed in 2D, it could easily be transformed into 3D using RDKit functions."

The molecular weights of the individual SMILES were then summed together to obtain the total molecular weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the oxidation state, the total charge of the ligands was determined with the help of a database containing the charges of various ligands. This information allowed the determination of the compound's oxidation state. However, a problem arose in a few cases where the metal preferred one oxidation state over another, even though it resulted in a charged complex instead of a neutral one (e.g., PtCl4, which prefers to be negatively charged even though Pt can have an oxidation state of IV). To address this issue, the total charge of the complex needs to be known and is requested from the user."

    "This Python package simplifies the study of chemical complexes by providing tools for 3D visualization, molecular weight calculation, and oxidation state determination. The Tkinter interface allows users to input ligands and metals (as SMILES) and choose the desired output, enhancing usability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite challenges in modeling complex structures, the approach of transforming 2D planes into 3D models using RDKit functions proved effective. Limitations include the constraints of the database and the inability to create interactive 3D images directly in Tkinter, which are instead rendered in a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the project successfully aids in visualizing and analyzing chemical complexes. Future improvements could enhance model accuracy and expand the ligand database to reduce errors. This tool is valuable for chemists in both research and education."
